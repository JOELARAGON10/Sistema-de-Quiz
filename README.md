The code represents an interactive evaluation system, ideal for delving deeper into a particular topic by answering a series of multiple choice questions. When you complete the questionnaire, the system will carry out a calculation of your answers and provide you with a final score, thus providing you with an evaluation of your performance on the topic in question.

The main purpose is to acquire knowledge about the selected topic through a system that will accompany you and give you feedback based on your answers to the questions. At the end of the process, you will receive a final grade that will reflect your performance and, in addition, any errors made will be pointed out so that you can consider them in future reviews and improve your understanding of the topic.
